I joined Pujini on 9th of July. Today it's 19th of September. 73 days. 49 days. 49 working days. 24 holidays. I got my first work assigned on 13 August. So technically for the first one month and 4 days I didn't really grow. Now the thing about working in a big company like Pujini is that, it's huge. The whole system is a huge network. Complex network. And it is kind of impossible to keep track of each and every thing. The codebase, is huge too. Being written by thousands of employee. I don't really know about the product based companies. But in service-based ones, the code written here, are mostly very elemenatary. What I mean by the word, "elementary" is that any being, with basic programming knowledge can code it. The main characters/features/skills you need to work here are:
1. Basic programming skills.
2. intutive mind- which builds as you code more and more.
3. The skill of being able to complete the work within thr given deadline, no matter if you are taking help from others/ writting the whole code from someone else.

Once you are a noob programmer, the next thing, I learnt about working in a service based IT company is that, every single employee is heavily depended on each other, which inevitable, given the code-base is huge and it's really difficult to like become know-it-all. It is simply impossible, unless you are venturing to spend the rest of your career and life in this particular company, becoming the CEO, some 20 years hence. If that's the plan, it maybe useful for you to be know-it-all.

I remember when I was firt assigned the work, there was a confusing regarding whether the changes were to be relflected back or just passed down the pipeline. I was told, the function of the class where I was supposed to make changes. I wrote the code. 4 lines. There were errors. I was directed to other people, 3 all in all. one of them replaced my code completely. Then I went for code review, that person replaced my replaced code. Testing, it was found that my code wasn't really working during testing. So we decided to make the changes only while in pipeline but then it was found that the changes are needed in OG.SO finally after a couple of more defects, I found today morning that the code I had written doesn't exist anymore. So 49 days, not really any visible good impact I had on Dell workwise.
