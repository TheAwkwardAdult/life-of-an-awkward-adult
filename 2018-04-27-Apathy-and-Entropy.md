Carl Newport in his book, "So good that you cannot ignore", says, three traits that defines great work are:
1. Creativity: opportunity to improvise your work and implement your ideas
2. Control: you have some say on how, when and where your work gets done.
3. Impact: your work has a positive influence on your co-workers or customers.

The only thing that differents passionate people from others is the fact that they find these 3 things in the work they do. 

After I was done with my school, I had no idea about what I really wanted to do with my life. I was lost. I had been a good student throught out my school days. Some of my friends were opting for science, some were opting for art, commerce. 

I took up science. I decided to prepare for engineering just because I liked writing computer programs and I didn't really know what all other options I had. 

When I started my undergraduation, I was determined to take up something as passion and work on it. I always wanted to be a researcher. But I was such a fucking dumb head. So fucking retard. Fucking shitty head. Shitty shit. lol. No I wasn't. Or was I? lol. What was the fucking problem with me? I am going through the same problem now. The problem is I wasn't focused. Why wasn't I focus? Fight against the odds. I don't have the will power. Why?
