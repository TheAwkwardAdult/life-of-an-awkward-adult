I joined Pujini on 9th of July. Today it's 19th of September. 73 days. 49 days. 49 working days. 24 holidays. I got my first work assigned on 13 August. So technically for the first one month and 4 days I didn't really grow. Now the thing about working in a big company like Pujini is that, it's huge. The whole system is a huge network. Complex network. And it is kind of impossible to keep track of each and every thing. The codebase, is huge too. Being written by thousands of employee. I don't really know about the product based companies. But in service-based ones, the code written here, are mostly very elemenatary. What I mean by the word, "elementary" is that any being, with basic programming knowledge can code it. The main characters/features/skills you need to work here are:
1. Basic programming skills.
2. intutive mind- which builds as you code more and more.
3. The skill of being able to complete the work within thr given deadline, no matter if you are taking help from others/ writting the whole code from someone else.

Once you are a noob programmer, the next thing, I learnt about working in a service based IT company is that, every single employee
