## About

A real life fictional character. Trying to fit in. Or not. Chasing dreams. And cats. This place is a where I share my experience, experiment results, my thoughts and wisdom. I will mostly write about my understanding on various topics. Mainly related to psychology, philosophy and newly acquired taste for cognitive science and relating religion and spirituality(mainly islam) with human psychology and science. I'm on a quest to understand the true meaning of life and purpose of our being and the working of human psyche. And cats. And maybe more.
