As a toddler I had heightened imagination. I and my sister had imaginary friends who we named Channi and Babarica. When my younger sister came into being, we created a new imaginary friend- Trifaula. I still have no clue where we got those name. At night when it was time to turn in and we still wanted to play, our parents told us, "Go to sleep or Dhopdhopi would come to get you." We had never really seen how this DhopDhopi looked like, but I imagined her to be a very old and fragile lady with a curved spine, supporting herself on a walking stick, with green shiny eyes and very shiny silver hair. Back in those days, we had a Bhahadur who used to come and hit the road with his stick making sound. I belived it was Dhopdhopi. One good evening, it rained heavily and the lights were out. We were getting cranky. The best way to keep small kids from creating havoc in house is, "Narrate them a horror story." It will scare them to death and keep them quite for really a long time.
“Who’s knocking at the door at such an hour of night?”
“No one, it’s the storm.”
“It’ very late night. Foxes are howling in the fields of Ullapara, “Hukka-hua’.”
“ What is that sound? Is that the Ekka-gari on the streets?”
“No it’s the thunder.”
“ The puppy is crying since a long time, I am unable to sleep”
“What’s that howling ?”
“ It’s the owls perching in the  Oshottho.”

“The wind is making the door knocker rattle.”
“Is someone crying?”
“No it’s the cat in the kitchen.”
The backyard with the drakness looming. I saw a pair of red eyes there. I close my eyes and curl near my mother's side. I try to put my arms around her. My sister is already on the otherside of my mother, hands around her waist. The cold air blowing through the window, the howling of the wind. I have never seen a fox, but I can imagine it's sharp teeth as it tears down the body of the children. 

"When we were kids, there had been cases of fox taking kids away tearing down it's body." Just another of those stories to scare the children. Have it ever occurred to you, fear of ghosts is something inculcated in children?
