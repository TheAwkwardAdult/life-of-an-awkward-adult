As a toddler I had heightened imagination. I and my sister had devised imaginary friends Channi and Babarica. When my younger sister was born, we created a new imaginary friend- Trifaula, just to keep up the symmetry in our real and imaginary world. I still have no clue where we got those name. At night when it was time to turn in and we still wanted to play, we were told, "Go to sleep or Dhopdhopi would come to get you." We had never really seen how this DhopDhopi looked like, but I imagined her to be a very old and fragile lady with a curved spine, supporting herself on a walking stick, with green shiny eyes and very shiny silver hair. Back in those days, we used to have a Bhahadur in our colony, who used to walk the street with his stick, hitting it on the ground with each step, to keep us alert during night from theives. I believed it was Dhopdhopi. One evening, it rained heavily and the lights were out. We were getting cranky. Pro tip: The best way to keep small kids from creating havoc in house is, narrating them a errie story. It will  keep them quite for really a long time.

“Who’s knocking at the door at such an hour of night?”

“No one, it’s the storm.”

“It’ very late night. Foxes are howling in the fields of Ullapara, “Hukka-hua’.”

“ What is that sound? Is that the Ekka-gari on the streets?”

“No it’s the thunder.”

“ The puppy is crying since a long time, I am unable to sleep”

“What’s that howling ?”

“ It’s the owls perching in the  Oshottho.”

“The wind is making the door knocker rattle.”

“Is someone crying?”

“No it’s the cat in the kitchen.”

"When we were kids, there had been cases of fox taking kids away tearing down it's body." My father used to tell us stories of his village. The Hunuman and the fox and the cases of them coming at night and carrying away small kids. That kept us from lurking out at night while we were visiting the village. One of my greatest fear as a child was a pair of red eyes appearing out of thin air in the looming darkness of our backyard. And then the pointed nose and the hairy body and bushy tail of the fox.

My first interview, I remember for admission to nursary class. They asked me counting 1-10 and Englsih alphabets. They asked me, "What more can you do?" I said I can recite poem with acts. I performed "Teddy bear". They gave me a chocolate, which I remember bringing back home to share with my sister. I remember them asking me my parents name. I asked if I could tell what my father calls my mother, they laughed. I thought, "Sheez, they are not going to take me."

I cleared it anyways. I wasn't very happy though.
