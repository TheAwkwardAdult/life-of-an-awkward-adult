## Apathy and Entrophy Part 1.


The second law of thermodynamics states that, "_In all spontaneous processes,[1] the total entropy always increases and the process is irreversible. The increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the asymmetry between future and past_."

Then who are we to deny science? Why are we bend on settling down? Are we being selfish? Are we being wise? Or are we being lazy?

I have reached that phase of my life, where as a functioning memeber of the society, I have made the foundation to the setteling down phase. Freshly brewed in the college. I got into an MNC. A decent job, a decent salary. What comes next?  Finding a good earning groom. Getting married. Get kids, a pet, buy a house in suburb and live it off lavishly? It sounds perfect. Normal. Sounds like what is socially accepted. 

We wake up to the sound of alarm. Start rushing, hustling. We are busy. Check whatsapp messages, check people's status

_busy.

busy.

busy._

This reminds me of an article published in 'The New York Time', 'The Busy Trap'. Of course it's not true for all people.Most people in this world are busy doing there routine each day. How many of us are really productive? What is about? Is it about being busy or productive? How do you know what you are actually doing in your life?

"Busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness; obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day."

Now the real question arises is, why do we have this emptiness in us? after all, you live only once, you are the most important person in your life, it is your happiness that matters. Whatever you are doing now, should make you happy not empty. 

The culprit, I may say is the way we are raised and brought up in this society. The education system. 

Happiness has always been pictured to us by the society as something which could be derived from outside, materials. Parents get happy when their kids scores good, when the kid wins the first prize, when the kid gets into the best school of the town, when he/she cracks toughest of exam and gets into the best university, gets a fat salary settles down. _Peace_. As a kid, we grow up learning these gestures from our parents and people that surrouds us. As the year passes and the kid grows, his soul dies each time he fails his parents. Finally, when he is a grown individual and is ready to take up it's own responsibility, he sees happiness as he has learnt it all the way, as something derived from the world around us. What we are missing is the fact that happiness whould be something coming from within not our surrounding.

He hustles, he gets busy to get promoted. Works days and night. Over-time. He is chasing happiness but is he really happy? He is busy right? Is this what we are living this life for? 

Who are the real happy people then? Does that mean that we should be spending more time in leisure activities and stop being busy?

Now here comes that section of society, bragging about "Passion". 

"Passion matters you know."

"Passion drives you."

"Life sucks without passion."

"How could you not be having a passion."

And hence bringing down the morale of already dying soul.

Some month backs, I came across this video debating on wheather passion really matters to succed in life. As I more come to think of it, as the narrator there says,
Your engagement in your work, your productivity and happiness depends on 3 main factors:
1. Creativity. : opportunity to improvise your work and implement your ideas
2. Control.: you have some say on how, when and where your work gets done.
3. Impact.: your work has a positive influence on your co-workers or customers.
