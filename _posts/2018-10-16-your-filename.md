## Love is an illusion of our own Device.

It's true that love makes us blind. As human, each individual as it's own way of thinking and percieving things. It is this difference that makes human a rich diverse species. 

Let's take the example of a glass partially filled with water. Some will say it's half full. Some will say it's half empty. 

While Diversity in thoughts is what makes us great. It sometimes leads to chaos in our life.

Love, since a long time, as been fantasied by us. The concept of being a special one to someone, that feeling of belonging to someone. The one most important person for you in the entire universe, having "The one" for you. It's really intriguing. Why shouldn't it not be? Well, that's the way we are designed. It's human. Right.

_Rick: Listen Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people calls "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it._

This the extract from a conversion from the show "Rick and morty", where Rick is trying to make his heartbroken grandson understand from his experience in love.

Well, For those, who have seen there family fall apart, their relationship fall apart, this might sound soothing. 

And to tell the truth, this is what actually it is. It's just a chemical reaction in us to just keep our race from extincting.

But not everyone is geek and not everyone likes to bre.. bree.. break it down so minutely.

The pop music culture, TV series, Web series and the novels by all romantic writers, these are the things we grow up with, which most of the time presents a very fake illusion of the world around us. We may not understand it in that depth, but as we grow with these things playing around us, it "puts unfair amount of pressure on the young people to find "Just the one/ love of life". Somehow or the other, the main story lines remove round any one of these elements:
1. A boy and a girl falls in love, fights, breaks up, finds each other again, lives happily ever after.
2. Somehow or ther other, even if they don't get back togather, they get back at other and finds a better love.

I am not saying love is overrated. What I am trying to say is, the idea of love becomes so overwhelming for an individual that he/she forgets the fact that your is not always about love, there are a lot of other things which are just as magical as a romatic relationship with someone.

When it comes to relationship, there are 2 kind of people:
1. The first category of people reason by emotions: these people are emotional and they let thier emotion overpower all other senses.
2. The second category of people, those who reason by practicality of the situation: These people know how to see every situatio, how it actually is, they don't let emotions overpower them.

Now, you may ask which category do I fall in? As far my obersation, in which category you fall i, depedns on the situation and also the person you are with.

What my experience say is that, most girls, always tend to reason by emotion. When your partner fails to fulfill your emotional needs, they feel betrayed... maybe? That's how it all starts.

For the second category of people it is slightly easier to get over a failed relationship, because their reasoning are strong. The trouble comes when the other person reason by emotion and all they are left with are heartaches, memories and the never dying hope that either the other person will come back or they will get back on them.

I have seen a lot of failed relationship closely, and a few success relationships. Now the one motivation for me to write this blog post was, this movie that I recently watched, _500 days of summer_.

There is a lot of things wrong in this world, in every sphere that is wreaking the young people of this world. The human pysch works in a very mysterious way. We may think that well, you know, my mind is mine, it's upto me, how I think and how I act, nothing's gonna affect it right? But unconsciousous what we see and hear, do have an impact on our perception of the world.

So, this movie starts with telling us about this boy named Tom, who like most of the boys of our generation, he listens to these pop musics and believe in the idea of "The one". 

Summer on the other hand, having seen her parent's divorce, doesn't believe in anything such sort. She always does what she wants and what makes her happy. They meet in office and on learning that Tom likes her, they start spending time with each other. From the start Summer makes it clear that whatever they are doing, she is not looking for anything serious. Tom, even plays along, but having the concept of "the one true love" and the fact that they are happy spending time with each other thinks they could be something serious. In one of the occasions, when they are talking, Summer realises and tells Tom how she has never revealed so much about her to anybody else. To this, Tom says, _"Maybe I am not just anybody else"_. 

Maybe this confirms Tom that she is the one for her and starts trying hard to make it work. He puts too much pressure on Summer through his actions, which make Summer unhappy.
