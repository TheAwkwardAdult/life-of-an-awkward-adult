For the past few days I having gut feelings about a lot of things turning real. And most of them being dark and bad. I am feeling this aura of darkness and I don't know how to deal with it. I had been having a lot of recurrent dreams about this same place- A tall grey building, in the end of a lane. I am there with my Mom and my father. Last week it came true. We visited this place that confirmed with the same building I had seen for a long time in my dreams. I don't know if it means anything or what it was about.

All my fears are slowly turning into reality. It's frigtening. I keep having these psychic feeling about people and situation and they turn out to be true. It's not like I predict them, it's just that I feel them about certain things. It's unsettling.
