"_It is the power of the mind to be unconquerable._"

Recently I came across this article in twitter about how often human mind is compared to a computer and is said to be an information processing system.

This article also happened to talk about a movie, "Transcendence". This movie made me really sad. As does most of the SciFci movies. 

The story revolves around 3 characters. 
Will: One of the greatest AI researcher having created world's most advanced AI.
Evelyn: Will's wife, deeply in love with him and her cause is to make this world, a better place to live in, by providing a pollution free ecosystem and healthy humans.
Max: Who is the best friend of Evelyn and Will and is conflicted with the idea of whether advancement in technology is a boon or a ban.

Due to an attack by an anti-technology group, Will is fatally injuried and has only a month to live. Evelyn in desperation to save the love of her life, decides to upload Will's consciousness into PINN( Physically Independent Neural Network), the greatest AI made in human history, after having coming to know one of the researchers had uploaded the consciousness of a monkey in a network.

Max is sceptic about it, but couldn't stand his best friend's plight and helps her through the process.

They do so successfully. But it is unclear whether Will is controlling the AI or thr AI is controlling the consciousness. 

The movie ends with us asking ourself was the PINN really self-aware. Was it really Will? OR just PINN?

After watching this movie, I had a numerous questions bubbling in my mind.

Would I prefer a perfect world, people who never fall ill and are superstrong, and the ecosystem is rid of pollution. The air, the water, everything is so pure. But then, everything is driven by just one conscious mind controlling and overriding all others?

Sometimes the future seems so bleak and it makes me so sad.

Consciousness or Self-awareness, this is the most mind boggling thing that reseachers are trying to decode for years. But to no avail.

Are we controlling the mind? Or is the mind controlling us. There are complexities of our mind that even we don't understand. Sometimes, I feel it's all a simulation. What if we are just living in a petri dish, in one of the experimenting lab? 

The life, we are living is a story woven by our consciousness, which we believe in and is living. All of us are given the same senario, a world to live in, and yet each and every brain precieve it differently. Which is so much different from a AI or machine. 

My thoughts are so conflicted between the idea that consciousness- could it be a physical thing or is it a mystic soul?
