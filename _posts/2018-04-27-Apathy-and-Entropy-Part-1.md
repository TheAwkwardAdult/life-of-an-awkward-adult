"_In all spontaneous processes,the total entropy always increases and the process is irreversible. The increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the asymmetry between future and past_."

This is the second law of thermodynamics and one of the earliest proof of the universe motivating us to not settle down for anything less and just taking risk, keep growing, exploring, innovating and most important keep increasing the chaos in the universe.

Then Why are we bend on settling down? Are we being selfish? Are we being wise? Or are we being lazy? 

We wake up to the sound of alarm. Start rushing, hustling. We are busy. Checking whatsapp messages, facebook, instagram, twitter, emails, 

_busy._

_busy._

_busy._

This reminds me of an article published in The New York Time, 'The Busy Trap'. Most people in this world are busy doing there routine each day. How many of us are really productive? What is this about? Is it about being busy or productive? How do you know what you are actually doing in your life?

_"Busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness; obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day."_

Now question arises, why do we have this emptiness in us? After all, you live only once, you are the most important person in your life, it is your happiness that matters. Whatever you are doing now, should make you happy not empty. 

What's going wrong? Why are we void inside? 

This is because the way we see happiness is wrong. 

Happiness has always been pictured to us by the society as something which could be derived from outside, materials. Parents get happy when their kids scores good, wins the first prize, kid gets into the best school of the town, when he/she cracks toughest of exam and gets into the best university, gets a fat salary, settles down. _Peace_. As a kid, we grow up learning these gestures from our parents and people that surrouds us. As the year passes and the kid grows, his soul dies each time he fails his parents. Finally, when he is a grown individual and is ready to take up it's own responsibility, he sees happiness as he has learnt it all the way, as something derived from the world around us. He is chasing something, he knows he's going somewhere, but he doesn't know where this is leading him to. He's lost. What we are missing is the fact that happiness should be something coming from within us not our surrounding (_material_).

He hustles, toild days and night to get promoted. He doesn't leave a stone unturned. Cutting off recreation, family time. Over-time at office. He is chasing happiness but is he really happy? He is busy right? Is this what we are living this life for? 

Who are the real happy people then? Does that mean that we should be spending more time in leisure activities and stop being busy?

Then we have those poeple in the society bragging about, "Passion". 

"Passion matters you know."

"Passion drives you."

"Life sucks without passion."

"How could you not be having a passion."

And hence bringing down the morale of already lost soul. 

Some month backs, I came across this video debating on wheather passion really matters to succeed in life. The narrator there says,
Your engagement in your work, your productivity and happiness depends on 3 main factors: _Creativity, Control, Impact._
