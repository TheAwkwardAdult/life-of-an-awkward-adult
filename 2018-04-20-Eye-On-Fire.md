This is a Friday reminder that you can be anything you want to be. Don't let people tell you that you set unachievable goals and then end up being disappointed which could have been avoided. Don't stop trying just to avoid being saddened and disappointed. They don't know what you know about yourself and your capabilities. People especially youth like us, expect to have y=mx+c career path. We have to understand the fact that minimas are unavoidable. 

There is no fun in y=mx+c. 

Accept disappointments. Dust yourself up. Get back up.

_Go with the mindset that, "I will go on despite the minimas." It's then and only then that you can be whatever you want to be._

_This is a Friday reminder that you can be all you want to be, given you don't let people tell you otherwise._

The summer of 2017 has been one of the toughest period of my life. Turbulant. Things were going too fast and yet too slow. I was beaten. I was lost. I was emotionally torn. There were a lot of reasons I was still fighting. Fighting to keep on. And among the few best friends I have, there was this one person, who really helped me out seeing things in different light. I had never turned back again. I was grateful to have him there to help me out. Even though I am still not anywhere near to what I really want to be in my life( mainly because I didn't know exactly), I am still struggling against all odds.

My perspective changed though. Just like me there are hundreds of youth out there, struggling to keep up, they are tormented inside, emotionally maybe physically and mentally. From outside, when you see them, they seem pretty cool, but you never know what he/she i going through. Therefore be kind. Always.

" It feels like my life is falling apart."

"My job, my relationship."

"I'm in Limbo."

"Sorry I am not emotionally fully stable." _This is what makes you human._

"Sometimes I wish I was an AI." 

"I have been told that I have excessively high standards for myself . I often pointlessly disappoint myself and then feel bad." _Well, you have an alternative, take up people's advice, stop setting high standards for yourself, settle down for whatever life offers you, stop  having high hopes. Just stop living._

The problem with today's youth is that, they expect a y=mx+c career path. They don't realise that minimas are unavoidable.
