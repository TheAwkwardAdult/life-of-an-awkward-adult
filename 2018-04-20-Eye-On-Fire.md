My first experience in Bangalore was memorable not in a good way. With a heavy heart and hope that my second experience would be better than the first one, I boarded the flight. Luckily we got a decent flat on rent nearby the office area. Me and my two friends shifted there the next day. It took us around a week to settle down. We hired a maid for cooking and household works. It was in a residential area unlike the last one. I liked it in the first sight. It was a peaceful ambiance, mostly occupied by families. And because of the absence of the traffic cacophony in that area, naturally, we were able to hear what was going on the household nearby. Our maid, who lived in the servent's quarter under our floor said she was able to hear whatever we talked about in the Kitchen. We could hear the conversations of the families, children reciting their lessons. Kids playing. 

Out of all these, one sound was most amusing and irritating to us. The crying of a small baby and the father pacifying the kid. In one instance we heard the father saying, "No!", each time the baby cried, we thought what kind of sick father is that. And the sound was more profound while we sat down to eat.

"Why does the kid always cry when we sit down to eat?"

"I think that is the cry of a ghost baby." snickered Arundhati.

"Well, yea, maybe it died out of hunger that's why he always cries when we sit down to eat?!"

And we started adding more and more details to the story.

There was a parenting book along with some stuff that the landlord had left behind.

"May be his parents worked in IT and were not good at parenting."

"Maybe after a day's hardwork, they went for a drink to a pub and forgot to feed the kid and it died of hunger."

Our humour was getting darker and darker. We started associateding all random things with the kid.

"So this was the hook where the baby hanged itself."

"Maybe we can people that, each time we heat the milk at night, in the morning we wake up to find all milk finised off."

"Guys, I'm booking the ride, we are already running late."

So I booked the ride, just like any other usual day. I hadn't packed my bag yet, so I asked my friends to go head down to the cab, while I will lock and come in a minute. I went to washroom to wash up. 

I came out, they had already left, I picked up my bag and locked the door, I got down. The cab was waiting. But I couldn't find my friends anywhere.

I called out thier name. No answer. I asked the driver to wait and went upstairs. Unlocked the door, I called out thier name again. No answer. I opened the door to the room and to my surprise, it was all empty. I chcecked Arundhati's room, it was empty too. I stood their frozen. From a distance I could hear the cab horns and a baby crying.
